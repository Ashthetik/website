## Welcome Stranger!
If you couldn't figure it out already, my name's Ashlynn! (Or Ash, you choose <3)
I'm a cybersecurity student with a couple years already under my belt in the industry from various gigs, such as Network Engineering, to Security Engineering, and even Bug Bounties!

I run in quite a few Capture the Flags (CTFs), dabble in various fields of Physics, and self-study and research Machine Learning with the hopes to apply the work I do into the medical field! 

If you ever need to reach out to me, feel free to email me (just hit the email icon on the sidebar) or pop into my team's discord server: [discord.gg/Gwv26ptnEZ](https://discord.gg/Gwv26ptnEZ)

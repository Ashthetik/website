# Network Fundamentals Study Notes

## Key Characteristics of Network Architectures

As networks expand, they must address four fundamental characteristics to meet user expectations:

- **Fault Tolerance**
    
- **Scalability**
    
- **Quality of Service (QoS)**
    
- **Security**
    

### Fault Tolerance

**Description:**  
Fault tolerance refers to the network's ability to limit the impact of hardware or software failures and recover quickly from such incidents. This characteristic is crucial for maintaining continuous service and minimizing downtime.

**Key Points:**

- **Redundancy:**
    
    - Achieved through duplicate connections or equipment between source and destination.
        
    - Ensures that if one component fails, another can take over, thus maintaining network functionality.
        
- **Importance of Fault Tolerance:**
    
    - Enhances reliability and user trust in the network.
        
    - Critical for mission-critical applications where downtime can lead to significant losses.
        

### Scalability

**Description:**  
Scalability is the capability of a network to grow and manage increased demand without compromising performance. It allows for the addition of more devices or users seamlessly.

**Key Points:**

- **Horizontal Scaling:**
    
    - Adding more devices to the network (e.g., switches, routers).
        
- **Vertical Scaling:**
    
    - Upgrading existing devices to handle more load (e.g., increasing bandwidth).
        
- **Considerations for Scalability:**
    
    - Network design should accommodate future growth.
        
    - Planning for scalability can prevent costly overhauls later.
        

### Quality of Service (QoS)

**Description:**  
Quality of Service refers to the overall performance of the network, particularly in terms of bandwidth, latency, and error rates. QoS mechanisms prioritize certain types of traffic to ensure optimal performance.

**Key Points:**

- **Traffic Prioritization:**
    
    - Ensures that critical applications receive the necessary bandwidth.
        
- **Latency Management:**
    
    - Reduces delays in data transmission, which is vital for real-time applications like VoIP and video conferencing.
        
- **Error Rate Control:**
    
    - Minimizes packet loss and ensures data integrity.
        

### Security

**Description:**  
Security in network architecture involves protecting data and resources from unauthorized access and attacks. It is a critical aspect of network design.

**Key Points:**

- **Access Control:**
    
    - Implementing measures to restrict access to sensitive data and resources.
        
- **Encryption:**
    
    - Protecting data in transit to prevent interception and unauthorized access.
        
- **Regular Updates and Patching:**
    
    - Keeping software and hardware updated to protect against vulnerabilities.
        

## Summary Table of Key Characteristics

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Characteristic|Description|Key Mechanisms|
|Fault Tolerance|Limits impact of failures; quick recovery|Redundancy|
|Scalability|Ability to grow without performance loss|Horizontal & Vertical Scaling|
|Quality of Service|Ensures optimal performance for critical applications|Traffic Prioritization, Latency Management, Error Control|
|Security|Protects data and resources from unauthorized access|Access Control, Encryption, Updates|
